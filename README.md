### Important Notice: CaliAli Update

CaliAli has undergone a major update! The previous version of the code described in the is now deprecated.

This update focuses on increasing the modularity of the CaliAli pipeline by restructuring how parameters and functions are handled.

Because of these significant changes, the previous workflow used to analyze data is no longer compatible, and older procedures will not work in the updated environment.

For detailed information about the latest changes and updates, please refer to the new [Online Documentation](https://caliali-pv.github.io/CaliAli/1.2/).
