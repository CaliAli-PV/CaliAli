### Important Notice: CaliAli Update

CaliAli has undergone a major update! The previous version of the code described in the [BioRxiv preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.19.540935v1) is now deprecated. If you need to access that version of the code, please switch to the [BioRxiv branch](https://github.com/CaliAli-PV/CaliAli/tree/Biorxiv-Version).
