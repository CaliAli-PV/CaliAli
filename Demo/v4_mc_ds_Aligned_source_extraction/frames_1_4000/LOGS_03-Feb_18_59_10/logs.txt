[18:59:10]Start running source extraction......
The collection of options are saved as intermediate_results.options_0

[18:59:10]Start initializing neurons from frame 1 to frame 4000

[18:59:28]	In total, 119 neurons were initialized. 
	The initialization results were saved as intermediate_results.initialization

Finished the initialization procedure.
[19:00:13]Start Merging neurons based on temporal correlations and neuron distances:
 	Thresholds:
		Temporal correlation of C: 0.650
		Minimum distance: 5.000
	All pairs of neurons are below the merging criterion!

 [19:00:13]Start Merging neurons based on temporal correlations:
 	Thresholds:
		Temporal correlation of C: 0.400
		Spatial overlaps: 0.800
		Spike count correlation: -Inf
	4 neurons will be merged into 2 new neurons.
[19:00:13]You approved all merges.
		41, 97, ---> 41
		96, 105, ---> 96
	The spatial and temporal components of the merged neurons were saved as intermediate_results.merge_03_Feb_19_00_13
	Now the old neurons will be deleted and the merged new ones will replace them.

[19:00:13]Deleted 2 neurons: 
97, 105, 
[19:00:13]Start Merging neurons based on temporal correlations:
 	Thresholds:
		Temporal correlation of C: -Inf
		Spatial overlaps: 0.900
		Spike count correlation: -Inf
	4 neurons will be merged into 2 new neurons.
